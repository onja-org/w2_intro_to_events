## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open **[`lesson/README.md`](lesson/README.md)** to review the concepts.  
2. Open **[`lab/exercise.md`](lab/exercise.md)** to see your exercise tasks.  
3. Edit **[`lab/exercise.js`](lab/exercise.js)** to complete the exercise.  
4. Open **[`lab/index.html`](lab/index.html)** in a browser to test your code.
