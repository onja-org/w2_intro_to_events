# Lesson: Intro to JavaScript Events

JavaScript events let your webpage respond to user actions â€” like clicking a button, typing in an input field, or hovering over an element.

# ðŸ§  What Are Events?

An event is something that happens in the browser â€” for example:

- Clicking a button (click)

- Typing in an input (input)

- Moving the mouse (mousemove)

- Submitting a form (submit)

# âš¡ Event Listeners

To make something happen when an event occurs, you use an event listener.

- element.addEventListener("eventType", callbackFunction);

- element â†’ the HTML element to watch

- eventType â†’ the event name (like "click", "input")

- callbackFunction â†’ the code to run when the event happens

**Example**
const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});

# ðŸ§© Callback Functions

The function you pass to addEventListner is called a callback â€” itâ€™s called back when the event occurs.

function showMessage() {
  console.log("Hello there!");
}

button.addEventListener("click", showMessage);

# ðŸ§° The Event Object

Every event automatically sends information about what happened â€” this is the event object.

button.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  console.log(event.target); // the element that was clicked
});


You can use it to access things like:

event.type â†’ type of event (click, input, etc.)
pages
event.target â†’ the element that triggered the event

# ðŸŒŸ Summary

Events make web pages interactive.

addEventListener() attaches an action to an event.

Callback functions run when the event happens.

The event object gives details about what occurred.
