# 📝 JavaScript Events Exercise

Welcome to the **Intro to JavaScript Events** exercise! Complete the following tasks using `exercise.js`.

## 1️⃣ Click Event
- There is a button in `index.html`.
- Add a **click event listener** that changes the text of the paragraph below the button when clicked.

## 2️⃣ Input Event
- There is an input field in `index.html`.
- Add an **input event listener** that displays what the user types in the paragraph below the input.

## 3️⃣ Hover Event
- There is a box in `index.html`.
- Add a **mouseover** (or hover) event listener that changes the background color of the box when hovered over.

## 💡 Tips

- Tip: Use `document.getElementById()` to select elements and `addEventListener()` to attach events.
- Use `console.log()` to inspect events and debug your code.  
- Complete one task at a time.  
- Experiment with different types of events to see how they behave.  
- Review the solutions only after trying the exercises on your own.
